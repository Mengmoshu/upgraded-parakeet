Data types to make render functions/classes for:
+ Text blobs with paragraphs
+ ColumnSplit
* SimpleList
* Inventory (Should probably put this in the Container class.)
* 2d arrays? (tabular data?)
* More formatted text: indents, colors.

Future capabilities:
* Scrolling

I still need to address communication from the game to the presenters.


Layouts:
column: Vertically arranged, sub-sized by list of dims, supports
auto.
row: Horizontally arranged, sub-sized by list of dims, supports
auto.
box: Single item, no sub-size.
+ columnSplit: 'pages' contents across columns, sub-sized by
column count, and maybe other stuff.

Nixed Layouts:
simpleGrid: evenly divides (based on what?)
