The topmost panel recieves some indicator to refresh, or maybe just has
'render' called.
It looks at the list of objects inside it and selects the top left one (fill a
list in this order? Or, better, a dict with the width and order, or whatever
the instance>arbitrary_data mapping collection would be.
Topmost calls render on each item one row of the screen at a time, the items
should already know their dimensions.

*----------------------*

DisplayTerminal.render (refresh?) is called. (Does this imply a callback
system?)

DisplayTerminal has a 2D list of object>offset mappings. The list is
iterated depth first, calling render on each object. The objects are expected
to know their width and height by this point.
